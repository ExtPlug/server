# @extplug/proxy

The default ExtPlug CORS proxy. This proxy is used by ExtPlug to load plugins
and room settings in case the servers they are hosted on are misconfigured, or
if the user blocked access to third-party domains using a JavaScript or ad
blocker.

This package is just [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) at
this point.
